    <Title>Odesa</Title>

    <Subtitle>Childhood</Subtitle>
    <Paragraph
      >My mother was born in Kazakhstan, and my father in Chernivtsi. They ended
      up in Odessa after university, both assigned to work at the same factory.
      That’s where they met and decided to stay. So, no, I can’t claim to be “an
      Odessan of the nine-hundred-and-thirty-eighth generation,” but the city
      became our home nonetheless.
    </Paragraph>
    <Paragraph
      >As a child, I lived with my family in the dormitory of a large Odessa
      factory where my grandfather was the director. The dormitory was near a
      market, a zoo, and an amusement park, and our weekends followed a familiar
      routine. My dad would put me on his shoulders, and we’d set off for the
      zoo. But what sticks in my memory most vividly is my enemy there — a
      llama. I didn’t know that llamas spit, or perhaps I just never learned my
      lesson. Every time we passed its enclosure, I’d get my dose of llama
      saliva, much to my father’s amusement. He’d cycle through every reaction —
      laughter, irritation, then eventually calling for my mom to come help.
      That’s one of my strongest memories of childhood: sitting on my dad’s
      shoulders, everything was fine, until the moment the llama made its
      presence known.
    </Paragraph>
    <Paragraph
      >There were two neighbourhoods that shaped my childhood. I grew up in one
      called Tairovo, but at some point, we moved to another called
      Cheryomushki. Both were residential, but I went to school in the city
      centre, which was a different world. In Tairovo, I learned about the
      everyday — mundane, practical things. In the city centre, I picked up more
      refined, cultural influences. These were two very different communities,
      each contributing to who I became.

    <Subtitle>Sounds, Smells, and Voices</Subtitle>
    <Paragraph
      >The sounds of Odessa are unforgettable: the gentle roar of the sea, the
      call of the lighthouse from the port, the market’s lively buzz, the
      clattering of the tram, and the melodies of street musicians. The city
      smells of the sea and sand, mingled with the heat—there’s a specific scent
      that comes from the mixture of saltwater, hot sand, and fish. And then
      there’s the fragrance of black locust trees, which fills the streets.
    </Paragraph>
    <Paragraph
      >Odesa isn’t just a place—it’s an experience, and much of that comes from
      the way people speak. One local peculiarity is called 'Shokanye.' (in
      Odesa, people replace the 'CH' sound with 'SH,' creating a soft, almost
      shushing effect). For example, instead of saying 'What-<b>ch</b>a you
      know?' it sounds more like 'Watt<b>sh</b>a you know?'.
    </Paragraph>
    <Quote
      >This unique speech pattern, often noted by outsiders, isn’t just an
      accent; it’s a reflection of Odesa’s humour and charm.</Quote
    >
    <Paragraph
      >The dialect is full of Yiddish words like 'bekitzer,' 'glick,' and
      'tukhes,' and the local slang reflects the city’s Jewish influence. For
      instance, the word for pancakes made from sprat isn’t just 'pancakes' —
      they’re called 'latkes.'
    </Paragraph>
    <Paragraph
      >Though I grew up in a non-religious family, Jewish food and customs were
      part of life. There was forshmak (stuffed fish), and babaganoush (eggplant
      pate). At the time, I didn’t question where it all came from, but later,
      the puzzle pieces started to fit. “Why is it Jewish if it’s from Odesa?”
      I’d think. But to me, it wasn’t so much about the religious significance
      as it was about the food — eggplants, for instance, are never as delicious
      anywhere else as they are in Odesa.</Paragraph

    <Quote
      >Odesa is a place where people answer a question with another question.</Quote
    >
    <Paragraph
      >They gesture with their hands when they talk. Even swearing becomes an
      art form, a blend of obscenities and local languages that somehow feels
      less offensive and more like a form of expression. There’s even a concept
      of ‘well-mannered swearing’ — non-offensive words spoken so harshly and
      affectionately at the same time that you realise you’ve messed up. Take
      the word 'woodpecker,' for example — no one really considers it an insult,
      yet somehow, it stings when said in just the right way. It’s a peculiar
      form of communication that you only really understand when you’ve lived
      it.

    <Subtitle>Places and Time</Subtitle>
    <Paragraph
      >As for the places that mean the most to me, I could say something cliché,
      like “home is where my family is,” but there are specific locations in
      Odesa that hold my memories. The market, the amusement park, the zoo —
      they don’t sound romantic, but for me, they are the heart of my childhood.
      Old Arcadia, Langeron — two beaches that have changed drastically over
      time but still carry the same familiar vibe. When I go there, memories
      flood back, as vivid as ever. Shevchenko Park, Gorky Park — these are all
      pieces of my past.
    </Paragraph>
    <Quote>More than anything, though, I miss the people.</Quote>
    <Paragraph
      >I miss the atmosphere. I miss walking down Deribasovskaya Street, the
      uneven paving stones beneath my feet, and the lively energy of the city
      all around me. It’s the peculiar charm of the people themselves — Odesans
      don’t always know how charismatic and unique they are. You can sit back
      and watch them forever, and somehow, it never gets old.
    </Paragraph>
    <Paragraph
      >May 2nd, 2014, was a terrifying day. It was the May holidays, and most
      people were out of town at their dachas. My friends and I were at a
      recreation centre with terrible cell reception, and when we finally got a
      signal, our phones froze from the flood of calls and messages from
      concerned relatives abroad. The events of that day spread across the
      globe. When we returned to the city after the holiday, it was as if
      nothing had happened — everything had been cleaned up and hidden away,
      except for the lives lost, which left a permanent scar on Odesa.
    </Paragraph>
    <Paragraph
      >And then there was February 24th, 2022. By then, I was living in Israel.
      I woke up to my phone vibrating with messages. At first, I didn’t know
      what was happening, but after reading the first message, I knew. War had
      come to Ukraine. That day marked the beginning of a terrifying new period
      — shock at first, and then fear as the situation worsened. I found myself
      in chats with displaced people, desperate to find shelter or a safe way
      out.
    </Paragraph>
    <Quote
      >I haven’t returned to Ukraine since the war began, but I’ve been at the
      border with Poland, and what I saw there was frightening. At the time, it
      was hard to process, but afterward, the fear crept in as I realised what
      we’d witnessed.</Quote
    >
    <Paragraph
      >I’m not sure what remains of Odesa. The city has been scarred by war, but
      I know there are places — like the beautiful buildings on Cathedral Square
      — that are slowly being restored. There’s also the sea port hotel, a
      building everyone hated because it blocked the sea view. When it was
      destroyed, some dark humour emerged, but that’s how Odesa is — a mix of
      tragedy and humour, all woven together.

    <Subtitle>Odesa and I: Tomorrow and Now </Subtitle>
    <Paragraph
      >It’s been almost seven years since I left Odesa. Yet, every year, I pack
      my suitcase and tell myself I’m going back. When the war started, I was
      ready to return immediately, but thankfully, those around me reminded me
      that I could do more to help from Israel than from Ukraine.
    </Paragraph>
    <Quote
      >It’s difficult because my heart is still divided between two places —
      Odesa and Israel.
    </Quote>
    <Paragraph
      >I grew up with strong Zionist values, but after living here for a while,
      I questioned them. I wondered if I had truly given Israel a chance, and
      even now, I wrestle with that. But I also know that I’m more useful here,
      where I can help the friends and family who need me. People in Odesa are
      running out of resources — emotional, financial, and others. Just being
      able to offer them a place of refuge, even temporarily, gives me purpose.
    </Paragraph>
    <Paragraph
      >I’ve tried to convince my parents to leave Odesa and come to Israel. The
      situation there is worsening, yet they refuse to go. Odesa is all they
      know, and they’re not ready to abandon it. Still, I hold out hope that one
      day they’ll agree to leave, even if just for a while. That hope is what
      keeps me grounded here.</Paragraph
    >
    <Quote
      >When the war in Ukraine started, I thought, “I’m not there, but I can
      help.”</Quote
    >
    <Paragraph
      >When the war in Israel began, I knew I wouldn’t leave. I’ve found a new
      purpose here, helping Ukrainians who fled one war only to land in another.
      They listen to people like me, people who understand both worlds.
    </Paragraph>
    <Paragraph
      >If I ever return to Odesa, the first thing I’ll do is go to the sea.
      There’s something about the Black Sea that I can’t find in Israel. As a
      child, I would stay in the water until my lips turned blue, my mother
      yelling for me to come out. Even now, the Black Sea feels like a close
      friend, the one I tell everything to, while the Mediterranean is more like
      an acquaintance — nice, but not the same. There’s something different
      about breathing in Odesa; it’s like I can fully exhale there.
